% We provide definition of commands that are used in all Lab Manuals

%\makeatletter       % We use this command because we want to refer to variables in our definition that contain the character @

%% We declare new variables which will be used in the title
%\def\@course{}      % The variables with @ in them are global and are used inside the \maketitle macro
%\def\@experimentnumber{}
%\newcommand{\course}[1]{\def\@course{#1}}       % We declare the \course command to be a means of setting the value of the \@course variable so that \@course is hidden from the end-user
%\newcommand{\experimentnumber}[1]{\def\@experimentnumber{#1}}

%% We customize the \maketitle command to make it generate the content that we want
%\renewcommand{\maketitle}{
   %{\hfill {\@course} - Experiment - \@experimentnumber}\\       % The braces around \@course forces it to respect the space that follows it
   %\begin{center}
      %{\Huge \@title}
   %\end{center}
   %\vspace{2\baselineskip}
%}

%\makeatother        % Stop treating @ as a normal character
