        \item Meter Rule
        \item Two Springs (with different spring constants)

\section{Single Spring}

    \subsection*{Objective}

        Calculate the spring constant of the two springs using Hooke's Law.

    \subsection*{Setup}

        Choose one of the springs and suspend it from the horizontal arm of the stand. Attach the mass hanger (no additional mass) to the bottom of the spring. This will cause the spring to stretch.% Once the spring comes to rest, use the meter rule to measure the new (extended) length of the spring. We will call this value $l_0$.

    \subsection*{Procedure}

        Successively add additional mass to the hanger and each time measure the total length $l$ of the spring (once the spring has come to rest). Record you results in a table with the following format. \textit{Note}: $m$ is the total mass you have added to the spring (including that of the hanger).

                \hline
            \end{tabular}
        \end{center}

    \subsection*{Calculation}

        Draw a graph of $l$ (y-axis) vs. $m$ (x-axis) including steep and shallow fit lines. Using Hooke's Law $m g = k x$ calculate the the spring constant from the slope of the graph. Calculate the corresponding uncertainty in the value of the spring constant using the steep and shallow fit lines on your graph.

        Repeat the procedure and calculations for the second springs.

        Record your results in a table with the following format. Pay particular attention to the uncertainty and units of your results.

                \hline
