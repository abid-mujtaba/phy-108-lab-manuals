% The common drawing instructions for the two setup diagrams

\cylinder
\flask[yshift=\Ch-0.1]    % Place flask with its anchor (origin) just below the top of the cylinder

\def\ar{1}                % Draw the miniscus of the glycerin
% To draw an arc with center (0, \Ch), radius \ar and starting and ending angles -60 to -120 we use the 'shift' option.
% The arc command uses a starting point and then angles and radius and NOT the center
% To overcome this we define the starting point as the center shifted to the starting point using polar coordinates. The ability to shift using polar coordinates is very useful here.
% So [shift=(-60:\ar)] applied to the coordinates of the center gives the starting position.
% The second part containing the start and end angles and the radius of the arc are straight-forward
\draw ([shift=(-60:\ar)] 0,\Ch) arc (-60:-120:\ar);

\def\sr{0.05}
\draw (0,2.5) circle [radius=\sr];       % The falling sphere
\draw [->] (0,2.5-\sr) -- (0,2.2);
