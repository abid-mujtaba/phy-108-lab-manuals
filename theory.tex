% Section explaining the theory governing the experiment

A compound pendulum (also known as a physical pendulum) consists of a \textbf{rigid} body oscillating about a pivot. This experiment uses a uniform metallic bar with holes/slots cut down the middle at regular intervals. The bar can be hung from any one of these holes allowing us to change the location of the pivot.

\section{Objective}

Derive an equation for the time period $T$ of the oscillations of a uniform metallic bar suspended from a pivot passing through it.
