# Lab Manuals for the Freshman Physics Lab (Mechanics)

These manuals have been written/revamped for the PHY-108 course at CIIT Islamabad (COMSATS Institute of Information Technology).

Each lab is contained in a separate branch. The 'master' and 'initial' branch are used to maintain the core code that is common to all manuals.

### Labs

* [Simple Pendulum](http://abid-mujtaba.github.io/phy-108-lab-manuals/docs/simple-pendulum.pdf)
* [Hooke's Law](http://abid-mujtaba.github.io/phy-108-lab-manuals/docs/hookes.pdf)
* [Viscosity](http://abid-mujtaba.github.io/phy-108-lab-manuals/docs/viscosity.pdf)
* [Compound Pendulum](http://abid-mujtaba.github.io/phy-108-lab-manuals/docs/compound-pendulum.pdf)
* [Rigidity](http://abid-mujtaba.github.io/phy-108-lab-manuals/docs/rigidity.pdf)
